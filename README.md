# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

This is a random passowrd generator and my first propject in JavaScript. The password generator will create a random password for you based on certain lengths and parameters of choice. Struggled a little bit with some of the conditional statements trying to find the most effecient way to structure the code and arrived on setting the conditionals with the window prompts, rather than trying to account for a ton of different possible choices. Learned some new ways to loop through and structure arrays on this one

## Usage
The script will execute upon hitting generate password and will feed you 5 different window prompts to choose from. The length of your password, whether or not you'd like lower case characters, upper case characters, numerical characters and symbol characters. Based on your answer your new password will spit out in the box above generate password.
